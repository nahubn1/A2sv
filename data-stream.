DISTANCE = 10
1. [25,...] --> element 25 got added to the stream, not enough numbers to form triplet, nothing happens
2. [25, 46,...] --> element 46 got added, nothing happens
3. [25, 46, 31,...] --> element 31 got added, enough numbers to form triplet 
but distance between some of them is greater than DISTANCE (e.g. abs(25 - 46) = 21 or abs(31 - 46) = 15)
4. [25, 46, 31, 23,...] --> element 23 got added, there are enough numbers to form triplet
and there is a triplet that satisfies our conditions, this triplet is (25, 31, 23),
distance between any pair of this triplet doesn't exceed
DISTANCE (abs(25 - 31) = 6, abs(25 - 23) = 2, abs(23 -31) = 8), 
we return this triplet and remove these numbers from the stream
After above operations stream becomes:
5. [46,....] and so on
